  abstract =	 {This paper describes an approach to reinforcement
                  learning in multiagent multiagent general-sum games
                  in which a learner is told to treat each other agent
                  as a friend or foe. This Q-learning-style algorithm
                  provides strong convergence guarantees compared to
                  an existing Nash-equilibrium-based learning rule.},
